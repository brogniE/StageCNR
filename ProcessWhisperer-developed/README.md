# ProcessWhisperer
Process optimizer that leverages the power of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to automatically fine-tune and optimize machine process parameters. By harnessing machine learning, the algorithm intelligently explores the parameter space to maximize process performance, enabling efficient and high-quality production. Use at the moment this two parameters for initialise the simulation `t_sim = 10;v_in = 4;`
## Initial model
The simplified model provided to us is shown below.

*(img 1) Representation of model components in Simulink*

In image 1 there are 2 pulleys connected by an ideal cable, in which a traction force generated by pulley A (driving pulley) is applied.
Therefore pulley A, turning at a certain input speed v_in, manages to make pulley B move.
The speed graph is shown in image 3.

*(img 3) Graph of the speeds coming out*

This graph rappresent the speeds coming out of the out.v component of img 1 with model input values `t_sim = 10` and `v_in = 4`, where `t_sim` indicates the simulation time, while `v_in` the force passed to Pulley A1.

## Introduction of a third pulley

*(img 4)*

In image 4 it shows how we added a third pulley (pulley C), spinning it via the same wire that connects pulley A to pulley B.
The pulley C introduced is therefore not driving, but rotates thanks to the force present on the cable generated by pulley A.
The distance that is present between A and C is determined by a parameter set by code.

*(img 7) Graph of the speeds coming out of pulley C*

In Images 6 and 7 the speeds of pulleys B and C are shown given, as input values, `t_sim = 10` and `v_in = 4`. It can be noted that unlike the version of the two-pulley model, the speed has decreased by about ten of units approximately.
This decrease in speed is given by the fact that with the same force exerted by pulley A the speed on C decreases, in fact in the 3 pulley model part of the force is dispersed to move pulley C.

## Introduction to a real 2-pulley model
<img src="img_README/2-pulley-realmodel.png" alt="drawing" style="width:750px"/>
The new model is composed of two belt pulleys, which represent two real pulleys whose size can be variable and the contact between the belt and the pulley is ideal. A rotation speed in radians is transmitted to pulley A as input, while pulley B is free in its rotation. The two pulleys are connected to each other by a cable on which two variables stiffness and dumping can be set as parameters.
